One of Australia's oldest and largest psychiatric institutions, with history dating to 1827 (New Norfolk Asylum). Later known as Lachlan Park Hospital, then Royal Derwent Hospital (closed 2000). The historic precinct now operates ghost walks and paranormal investigations as Willow Court Asylum. Recognized as an International Site of Conscience. Public controversy around paranormal tourism framing at this significant disability rights and psychiatric care history site is well documented and useful for ethical analysis."
