    "notes": "Former Her Majesty's Prison Ararat (gaol), subsequently used from 1886 to house the criminally insane as J Ward, part of the Ararat Lunatic Asylum / Aradale precinct. Now operates as a heritage museum with regular day tours and occasional night/ghost programming. More museum-oriented than haunted-attraction in character, but still fits dark programming criteria with crime and asylum framing. Situated within walking distance of Aradale."
