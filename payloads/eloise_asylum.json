    "notes": "Former Wayne County Poorhouse/Almshouse complex (est. 1839) that expanded to include a psychiatric hospital, tuberculosis sanatorium, and general hospital. At its peak housed thousands of patients and staff across dozens of buildings. The psychiatric hospital was officially the Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary. Now operates as a haunted attraction and history tour venue. Official marketing text is strong for discourse analysis; watch for boilerplate repetition."
